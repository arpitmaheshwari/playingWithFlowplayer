           <p>In this tutorial, we take the out of the box Asset Performance mashup and modify it to add a grid table showing Maintenance Orders from an external database. We will use the Postgres database since the Thingworx Manufacturing Apps installer supports this by default. The Maintenance Orders are stored in a table and we use an SQL query to extract the relevant data and display it in the context of an asset.</p>

           <p></p><p>The Custom Asset Viewer Application is one of the sample applications showing how the Thingworx Manufacturing Apps suite can be extended to build custom apps.  In this example, we took the OOTB asset performance mashup and modified to add a grid table which shows the Maintenance Orders from an external database. We used Postgres as the database, as the Thingworx Manufacturing Apps installer supports it by default. The Maintenance Orders are stored in a table and a SQL query is used to extract the relevant data and display them in the context of an asset.</p><p><img alt="" style="width:100%; " src="https://hqlexprdap01.ptc.com/data/tutorials/promo_page_assets/ThingWorx_Custom_Asset_Viewer.png"></p><p>The developers can take this sample application and extend it to create the Maintenance Orders when alerts are triggered in the system based on pre-determined criteria. This also shows how to take advantage of existing mashups and repurpose them for similar use. This example along with other configuration videos/documents will demonstrate how quickly applications can be built using Thingworx Manufacturing Apps.</p><p></p>
